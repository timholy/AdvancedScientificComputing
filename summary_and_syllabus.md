# Advanced scientific computing: producing better code

Many scientists are self-taught coders and struggle to learn the skills that best support collaboration, rigor and reproducibility, good design, extensibility, and wide community adoption.  Like so many other aspects of being a scientist, these are all skills that can be taught and learned via practice.

This nanocourse focuses primarily on tools and habits that make it easier to succeed in writing robust, flexible, and widely-adopted code.  Process-oriented topics include Git and GitHub, test-driven development, the workflow of continuous integration, and documentation and software releases.  More conceptual topics include principles of good design and the mechanisms for writing high-performance code.  Students will be introduced to all these issues via the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/), although some lessons will apply broadly.

This course is aimed at people who are comfortable in at least one programming language; it is not suitable for programming beginners.  Participants should plan to allocate several hours each week for homework assignments.
